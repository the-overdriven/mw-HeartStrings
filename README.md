# mw-HeartStrings
My fork of [HeartStrings](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/52965) mod by Archimag, MUSE successor (custom music).

Provides additional feature missing in the original version:  
It resumes the previous track when transitioning the theme, for example: switching from a wilderness theme to a battle theme and then back to the wilderness theme will play the same track, as it played before the transition. It even resumes the previous track from the moment when the change happened, rather than repeating the same track from the beginning.

Requires [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) and [luacom](https://github.com/the-overdriven/mw-HeartStrings/blob/main/luacom.dll).

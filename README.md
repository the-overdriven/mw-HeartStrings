# mw-HeartStrings
My fork of HeartStrings mod, MUSE successor (custom music).

Provides additional feature missing in the original version:  
It resumes the previous track when transitioning the theme, for example: switching from a wilderness theme to a battle theme and then back to the wilderness theme will play the same track, as it played before the transition. It even resumes the previous track from moment when the change happened rather than repeat the same track from the beginning.

Requires [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) and [luacom](https://github.com/the-overdriven/mw-HeartStrings/blob/main/luacom.dll).
